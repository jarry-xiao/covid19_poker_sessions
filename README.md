I built a program to distribute Venmo transactions among the winners and losers in a medium stakes online poker game. 

The script parses a Google Sheets document with all of the game results and figures out a reasonable way to distribute cash in the post-game settlement. This allows the game to run without having a centralized "banker" deal with all of the accounting.
